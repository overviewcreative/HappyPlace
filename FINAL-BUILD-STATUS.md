## ⚠️ Minor Notes

### **SCSS Deprecation Warnings** (Non-breaking)
- Using legacy `@import` syntax (will be updated to `@use` in future)
- Using legacy color functions (`lighten`, `darken` - can be modernized)
- Using `/` division syntax (can be updated to `math.div`)
- **Impact**: None - builds successfully, just future-proofing needed

### **Next Steps** (Optional)
1. ✅ **Build system is fully operational**
2. ✅ **All components are functional**  
3. ✅ **Theme is production-ready**
4. 🔄 Modernize SCSS syntax for future compatibility (optional)
5. 🔄 Add additional dashboard sections as needed (optional)
