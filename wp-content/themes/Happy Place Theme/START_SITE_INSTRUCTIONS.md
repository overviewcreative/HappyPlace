# Diagnostic and Setup Instructions

## Current Status: Database Connection Error ❌

The single listing template system has been fully configured and built, but WordPress cannot connect to the database. This indicates the Local by Flywheel site is not running.

## 🚀 **Immediate Next Steps**

### 1. Start Local by Flywheel Site
1. Open **Local by Flywheel** application
2. Find your site **"tpgv12"** 
3. Click the **"Start Site"** button (green triangle)
4. Wait for services to start (MySQL, Nginx/Apache, PHP)

### 2. Verify Site is Running
Once started, you should be able to:
- Visit the WordPress admin: `https://tpgv12.local/wp-admin/`
- View the frontend: `https://tpgv12.local/`

### 3. Test Single Listing Template
After the site is running:
1. Go to **WordPress Admin** → **Posts** → **Listings**
2. View or create a listing post
3. Visit the single listing page to test the template

## 🛠️ **What We've Already Completed**

### ✅ Template Loading System
- Template_Loader class configured and working
- Template files in correct locations
- Asset loading conflicts resolved

### ✅ Component System Built
- All JavaScript components: `living-experience.js`, `mortgage-calculator.js`, `photo-gallery.js`
- All SCSS styles compiled
- Webpack bundle: `single-listing.js` with cache-busting
- Auto-initialization system ready

### ✅ Asset Integration
- Theme asset loading system configured
- Component integration complete
- Build system working (`npm run build` succeeded)

## 🔧 **If Site Still Won't Start**

### Check Local by Flywheel Services
```bash
# In Terminal, check if MySQL is running
ps aux | grep mysql

# Check if ports are in use
lsof -i :3306  # MySQL
lsof -i :80    # Web server
```

### Alternative: Manual Database Start
If Local won't start, you might need to:
1. Restart Local by Flywheel application
2. Check Local's error logs
3. Reset the site in Local (if necessary)

## 📁 **File Structure Verification**

### Templates (Ready)
- ✅ `templates/listing/single-listing.php` - Main template
- ✅ `templates/listing/hero.php` - Hero section
- ✅ `templates/listing/details.php` - Property details
- ✅ `templates/listing/gallery.php` - Photo gallery
- ✅ `templates/listing/features.php` - Features list

### Components (Built)
- ✅ `assets/dist/js/single-listing.js` - Combined JavaScript bundle
- ✅ `assets/dist/css/main.css` - Compiled styles
- ✅ `assets/dist/manifest.json` - Asset mapping

### Bridge Functions (Ready)
- ✅ `inc/template-helpers.php` - Theme-plugin integration
- ✅ `inc/template-bridge.php` - Data bridge functions

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Site Starts**

1. **Template Loading**: Single listing pages will use custom template
2. **Component Initialization**: JavaScript components will auto-initialize
3. **Asset Loading**: Webpack bundles will load with proper cache-busting
4. **Styling**: All components will be properly styled
5. **Functionality**: Photo gallery, mortgage calculator, living experience features will work

## 📞 **Still Having Issues?**

If the site starts but the template still doesn't display correctly:

1. **Check Debug Log**: Look at `wp-content/debug.log` for errors
2. **Browser Console**: Check for JavaScript errors
3. **Template Verification**: Ensure listing posts exist and are published
4. **Plugin Activation**: Verify Happy Place Plugin is active

All the technical groundwork is complete - the remaining issue is just getting the Local site running!
