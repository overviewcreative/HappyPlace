   WORDPRESS REQUIRED THEME HEADER
   
   This file serves ONLY as the WordPress theme identifier.
   All actual styling is handled by the webpack-compiled main.css file
   loaded through the Asset_Manager system.
   
   DO NOT ADD STYLES HERE - Add them to assets/src/scss/ files instead.
   ============================================================================ */

/* 
   CRITICAL: This file must exist for WordPress theme requirements,
   but contains NO actual styles to prevent conflicts with the
   modern asset management system.
   
   All theme styling is loaded via:
   - assets/dist/css/main.[hash].css (webpack compiled)
   - Managed by inc/core/class-asset-manager.php
   - Source files in assets/src/scss/
   
   If you need to add styles:
   1. Add to appropriate SCSS file in assets/src/scss/
   2. Run webpack build: npm run build
   3. Styles will be compiled into main.css automatically

   Emergency fallback styles - ONLY if Asset_Manager fails
