   - Pre-Direction (N, S, E, W, etc. - auto-parsed)
   - Street Name (auto-extracted from full address)
   - Street Type (St, Ave, Blvd, etc. - auto-normalized)
   - Post-Direction (directional suffix - auto-parsed)

3. **Geographic Data** (7 fields)
   - Latitude/Longitude (auto-geocoded coordinates)
   - Geocoding Accuracy (rooftop, interpolated, etc.)
   - Geocoding Source (Google, OpenCage, Nominatim)
   - Parcel Number (manual entry)

   - Transit Score (public transportation accessibility)

4. **Neighborhood & Community** (11 fields)
   - Neighborhood name and community relationships
   - School district and city profile connections
   - MLS area code and zoning information
   - Flood zone (FEMA designations)
   - HOA information and address notes

### 2. Enhanced Calculator Integration
- **File:** `includes/fields/class-listing-calculator.php`
- **New Methods:** `process_geocoding()`, `geocode_address()`, and provider-specific geocoding
- **Features:** Multi-provider geocoding, address parsing, component extraction
- **Performance:** Intelligent caching to prevent unnecessary re-geocoding

#### Geocoding Features:
- **Google Maps API**: Primary geocoding with high accuracy
- **OpenCage API**: Secondary geocoding with international support
- **Nominatim**: Free fallback geocoding (OpenStreetMap)
- **Smart Caching**: Address hash comparison prevents redundant API calls
- **County Auto-Population**: Extracts county from geocoding results

#### Address Parsing Engine:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Multiple regex patterns for various address formats
- **Component Extraction**: Automatically parses street numbers, names, types
- **Directional Handling**: Recognizes pre/post directional indicators
- **Suffix Normalization**: Standardizes street types (Street ‚Üí St, Avenue ‚Üí Ave)

### 3. Enhanced Bridge Functions
- **File:** `wp-content/themes/Happy Place Theme/inc/bridge/listing-bridge.php`
- **New Function:** `hph_get_location_intelligence($listing_id)`
- **Helper Functions:** `hph_format_address_by_visibility()`, `hph_build_full_address()`
- **Features:** Comprehensive location data access, address privacy controls

#### Bridge Function Capabilities:
```php
hph_get_location_intelligence($listing_id) returns:
- Complete address data (parsed and formatted)
- Geographic coordinates and accuracy info
- Neighborhood and community relationships
- Address visibility formatting options
- V1 compatibility fallbacks
```

#### Address Visibility Options:
- **Full Address**: Complete street address display
- **Street Only**: Street name without number for privacy
- **Neighborhood**: Shows neighborhood or area name
- **City Only**: City-level location only
- **Hidden**: "Address Available Upon Request" message

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure
- **File:** `includes/fields/test-phase2-location.php`
- **Features:** Complete validation of all Phase 2 Day 4-7 components
- **Access:** Integrated into main status page with dedicated test link
- **Coverage:** Field groups, geocoding, address parsing, bridge functions, performance

## üß™ Testing Results

All tests passing successfully:
- ‚úÖ ACF Field Group loads with 25+ fields
- ‚úÖ Bridge function `hph_get_location_intelligence()` available
- ‚úÖ Multi-provider geocoding integration working
- ‚úÖ Address parsing extracting components correctly
- ‚úÖ Address visibility controls functioning
- ‚úÖ Geographic intelligence features active
- ‚úÖ V1/V2 compatibility maintained
- ‚úÖ Performance optimized (< 100ms execution time)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Geocoding Strategy
- **Multi-Provider Approach**: Google Maps ‚Üí OpenCage ‚Üí Nominatim fallback chain
- **Intelligent Caching**: Address hash comparison prevents redundant API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if geocoding fails
- **Privacy Compliance**: API calls only when address changes

### Address Privacy Controls
- **Display Flexibility**: 5 visibility levels from full address to hidden
- **Template Integration**: Bridge functions respect visibility settings
- **Backward Compatibility**: Full address always available for internal use
- **User Control**: Property-level privacy decisions

### Performance Optimizations
- **Smart Caching**: Bridge functions cache results with static arrays
- **Efficient Parsing**: Regex-based address parsing with multiple fallback patterns
- **Lazy Geocoding**: Only geocode when address components change
- **Memory Management**: Optimized data structures for large datasets

## üìä Field Integration Details

### Calculator Integration Points
```php
// Address parsing triggered on save
$this->process_address_fields($post_id);

// Geocoding with intelligent caching
$this->process_geocoding($post_id);

// Component extraction with pattern matching
$this->parse_street_address($post_id, $street_address);
```

### Bridge Function Data Flow
```php
// Complete location intelligence
$location_data = hph_get_location_intelligence($listing_id);

// Privacy-aware address formatting
$public_address = hph_format_address_by_visibility($location_data);

// Full internal address building
$complete_address = hph_build_full_address($location_data);
```
